    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Toronto, Ontario-based jazz ensemble BadBadNotGood make expansive music that
        straddles the line between '70s soul-jazz, alternative hip-hop, and experimental
        electronica. BadBadNotGood initially gained attention in the early 2010s playing
        jazz covers of hip-hop tracks by the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future"
            target="blank">Odd
            Future</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Doom" target="blank">MF Doom</a>. It was a sound
        they developed on their first two records, 2011's BBNG and 2012's BBNG2, covering songs
        by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tribe_Called_Quest" target="blank">A Tribe Called Quest</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West" target="blank">Kanye West</a> as well as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_(band)" target="blank">My Bloody Valentine</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_(singer)" target="blank">Feist</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then, they have balanced working on their own original songs as on 2016's IV,
        and collaborating on projects with hip-hop artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostface_Killah"
            target="blank">Ghostface Killah</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaytranada" target="blank">Kaytrandada</a>, and <a

    <h2>Who are they?</h2>
    <p>
        The group includes keyboardist Matthew Tavares, bassist Chester Hansen,
        saxophonist Leland Whitty, and drummer Alexander Sowinski. Matthew Tavares, Alexander Sowinski, and Chester
        Hansen
        met in 2010 through
        the Humber College jazz program in Toronto. The trio united over a shared love for hip hop music, including that
        of
        MF Doom and Odd Future.
        Hansen plays acoustic and electric bass in the group, while Sowinski, who often dons a pig mask during
        performances,
        is on drums and sampler.
        Tavares handles keys, playing rhythms on a Prophet '08 and electric piano. The name of the band came from the
        tentative title of a comedy television
        project that Tavares was working on, which was eventually abandoned.
